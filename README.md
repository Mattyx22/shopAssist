# shopAssist


It's my first project using nodejs/expressjs which can manage client database, warehouse state using mongodb.
There's a lot of things to do now, so I guess I'll be uploading new things and improvements here. 
Feel free to comment my code because every single tip from you would be helpful (as I said - I'm still going into the world of programming :) )
